# Current workflow
1. Managing Editor (ME) accepts a paper on the Editorial Express (EE) system. Journal Manager (JM) receives an automated email from the EE system.
2. JM emails the manuscript of the accepted paper to Martin Green (OUP). This is mainly for OUP to see whether they would want to put extra marketing efforts on certain articles.
3. JM emails the manuscript to the Data Editor (DE) for them to have an accepted paper on record.
4. JM emails instructions to the submitting author to ask them to:
    (a) send source files for the final version of the manuscript, i.e. .tex, .pdf, and .eps, .tif files for figures and diagrams, and .xls for tables, etc. wherever applicable, , as well as any online appendix
    (b) send the relevant data/simulations/code together with a readme file to the Data Editor (DE)
    (c) format the manuscript in the OUP style (only if the authors wish to do so themselves)
    (d) complete a Manuscript Submission Form
5. JM receives the package of files in (3) and sends to the ME to check.
6. DE receives replication package and reviews it for accuracy and clarity. Almost always, DE contacts the author for further clarification. ME is only contacted in case of major concern or discrepancy.
7. Once ME and DE both confirm with JM that all files are okay, JM sends everything to OUP by FTP transfer.
8. JM puts the accepted manuscript (only) on the 'Accepted papers' section of the Restud website. 
9. OUP contacts the submitting author to confirm licensing agreements and starts the typesetting process. OUP puts the accepted article on the OUP Advance Article page in the first instance until the article is published in an issue. The supplementary files are packaged in a zip file and made available on the OUP website. Once an article appears on the OUP Advance Articles page, JM changes the link to the article on the Restud website to point to the OUP AA page.
10. OUP sends article metadata (author, title, DOI if available) to DE.
11. DE uploads replication materials on Zenodo, noting the metadata and pointing to OUP AA page.
