# Uploading the first version of your replication package
1. Package all your files with their full directory structure in a ZIP archive. Please do not use any other archive format and do not compress files within the ZIP archive (i.e., no ZIP within the ZIP). 
2. You need a Zenodo account to publish your files. [Sign up](https://zenodo.org/signup/) if you do not have one yet. 
3. Create a [new Zenodo entry](https://zenodo.org/deposit/new?c=restud-replication) for your replication package. Make sure to use this link so that the Review receives your package once you are finished.
4. Upload your ZIP archive to Zenodo by "drag and drop" or selecting "Choose files." Make sure to push the green "Start upload" button after selecting your files.
5. Select "Dataset" or "Software" as your upload type.
6. Fill in the required metadata about your upload.
	- Title: "Replication package for: {full title of your manuscript}"
	- Authors: Typically same as manuscript authors, but can you can add others who have contributed significantly to the code you are uploading (such as research assistants).
	- Description: Include a full citation of your manuscript and a one-sentence description of what the replication package contains.
	- Do not worry about other metadata, these will be filled out by the journal office once the paper is published.
7. Select an open access License for your upload. Our [Data Availability Policy](https://www.restud.com/submissions/) requires that you allow readers to download, copy and modify your replication package. We recommend a "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International" license, but if you wish to use a different license, select "Other (Attribution)."
8. "Save" and then "Publish." This will notify the Data Editor who will review the files you submitted.
9. Make note of the DOI number issued by Zenodo. You will need to cite this in the [Data Availability Statement](https://academic.oup.com/journals/pages/authors/preparing_your_manuscript/research-data-policy#data2) at the end of your manuscript.
